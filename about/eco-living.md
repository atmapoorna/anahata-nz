Eco Living
======================

## Sustainable Living

A healthy lifestyle & healthy environment go hand-in-hand. Sustainable living is intrinsic to the yogic tradition. At Anahata we practise energy efficiency, water conservation & waste management. We use solar power, composting toilets & unique eco-friendly Earth & straw buildings. We are also caretakers of the ecologically significant flora & fauna of Golden Bay with an active interest in conservation in the region.

### Organic Garden

Our organic garden is an ongoing project. It is being developed along Permaculture design principles and is largely bio-dynamic. The garden produces a range of vegetables and herbs that are used daily in our delicious vegetarian meals. All scraps from meals are used to make compost or fed to our worm farms, where the worms happily transform bits of fruit and veggies into worm castings, which are then used, along with the compost, to mulch trees and the garden.

### Solar Panels

Alternative Power
Anahata is not connected to the electrical grid. We rely on solar power, and we try to minimize our electrical usage to make a minimum impact on the environment. A hydro unit to complement our solar power is a future project.


### Eco Buildings

At present, we have three ecological straw-bale buildings. These types of buildings have excellent insulation, staying warm in the winter and keeping cool in the summer

#### Composting Toilets
Anahata has three composting toilets, helping to minimize water usage. The compost from these toilets is used to mulch trees around the property.

#### Green Cleaning
We use biodegradable, environmentally friendly cleaners at Anahata.
