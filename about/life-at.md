# MISSION STATEMENT


To inspire the development of the whole being by providing a supportive environment for SATYANANDA YOGA® education and a high quality yogic experience. To do this we aspire to be aware, present and connected to the higher source.

# LIFE AT ANAHATA


Anahata Yoga Retreat is an integral residential yoga retreat in New Zealand, and it is a fully affiliated SATYANANDA YOGA® centre. Based on Ashram principles, Anahata is an inspiring & supportive yogic environment. It is a dynamic environment as well; as guests and residents come and go for different lengths of stays – from one night to several years. Everyone is welcome regardless of age, background or level of yoga experience.

At Anahata, yoga is more than physical exercise, it is a way of being, a way of living, an attitude with life and towards life, a yogic lifestyle. Yoga provides the tools to live a balanced, grounded and more centred life. These potentials dwell within you. Discover a stronger foundation of your self, renewed energy and a broader perspective of possibilities for your life.

At Anahata we live, share and teach the yogic lifestyle. Our integral approach provides inspiration to enrich your life as well as valuable skills to take away & incorporate into your day-to-day activities. The benefits can be experienced on a mental, emotional, psychological and spiritual level.

The SATYANANDA YOGA® tradition draws on many paths of yoga, such as Hatha Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Raja Yoga, as well as practices developed by Swami Satyananda, such as Satyananda Yoga Nidra™. For information of these different paths see the branches of yoga page. All modalities are not for everyone, but through exposure to many different approaches, each individual can experience a wholistic range of options suited to their body, mind and lifestyle.

Anahata offers varying levels of immersion in yogic lifestyle and training for individuals and groups. People may come for:
    
- A relaxed stay to recharge their batteries
- For a retreat to learn about or deepen their understanding and experience of yoga
- For personalised health or lifestyle consultations
    For in-depth, long-term training
    
    We encourage guests to participate in the daily activities with Anahata residents. Some of the activities that residents perform as part of their Karma Yoga include cooking, gardening, chopping wood, building and office work.
    
    Our facilities accommodate up to 30 guests at a time, with extra space available for tent sites. Families and children are welcome to visit Anahata, however due to limited facilities, we encourage families to bring a tent or stay in our private guesthouse, Chakra, which will give you more privacy.
    
    Please understand that some scheduled sessions are not appropriate for younger children, and it is important to be mindful of other guests’ experiences. Parents or guardians are responsible for their children at all times.
    
    Three healthy, nutritious vegetarian meals (organic as much as possible) and afternoon tea are provided daily. Special dietary needs can be accommodated with prior notification. Click here for more information on the food at Anahata. Click here for information on a Yogic Diet.

        ASHRAM PRINCIPLES
        
        
        Anahata Yoga Retreat is based on the principles of an Ashram or “place of work”. We strive to provide an environment for growth and personal development by maintaining a healthy and balanced atmosphere.
        
        Please come prepared for a yogic life style. Our routine is simple but well tried and tested in retreat centers and ashrams around the world. Everyone is invited to participate in our daily morning circle at 8.30am after which there are classes, free time or Karma Yoga.
        
        Karma Yoga is an integral yogic practice and discipline described as “mindfulness meditation through action”. Karma Yoga is ideally practiced in mouna or silence and provides an opportunity to examine one’s mind, emotions and action as well as contributing to Anahata Yoga Retreat.
        
        Karma Yoga is beneficial for everyone, and as we recognize differing levels of need, there are different Karma Yoga hours depending on your stay. You are welcome to participate in karma yoga activities or you may choose to have some quiet time to relax and recharge your batteries. Anahata Yoga Retreat is a great place to contemplate and enjoy the beautiful surrounds of Golden Bay.
        
        A rostered cook prepares all meals. We have a closed kitchen. No private cooking is permitted.
        
        The practice of Mouna or silence occurs from 8:30pm-8.30am in order to give space for the mind to turn inwards and to go deeper into witnessing your thoughts and feelings. External silence will eventually lead to inner awakening.
        
        THE MEANING OF THE WORD 'ANAHATA'
        
        
        Anahata is the fourth chakra or energy centre according to the Yogic and Tantric (Shakta) traditions. In Sanskrit the word anahata means “un-struck” or “unbeaten” and is related to the heartbeat, unbroken rhythm and the soundless sound.
        
        Anahata is often called the “heart” centre, symbolising the qualities of compassion, acceptance, universal love, selflessness and devotion that are associated with the awakening of this centre. These qualities are central to our purpose and inspire our attitudes and actions here at Anahata Yoga Retreat.
